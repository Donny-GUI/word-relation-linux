## How it works

1. Use the wikipedia api to get two topics
2. filter out 1000 of the most common words in english out of both list
3. compare the two lists against each other
4. get the percentage of words in one that is in the second and visa versa
5. check to see if words in one title are in another title and visa versa
6. use a scale to judge to relation
